This worksheet is a condensed version of Jenny's stat545.com functions [part1](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-01.html), [part2](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-02.html), and [part3](http://stat545.com/block011_write-your-own-function-03.html).

## Syntax Demo

Let's demo the syntax of function-making.

```{r}
#These all do the same things

square1 <- function(x) {
            x^2
}

square2 <- function(x) {
             y <- x^2
             y
}

square3 <- function(x) {
             y <- x^2
             return(y)
             5 #even if you have 5 here, the function will still return what you said to return. In this case return(y)
}

square1(4)
square2(4)
square3(4)

```

## Motivating example: max minus min.

Find the max minus min of the gapminder life expectancy:

```{r}
?min
?max
max(gapminder$lifeExp) - min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

Exercise: turn this into a function! i.e., write a function that returns the max minus min of a vector. Try it out on the gapminder variables.

```{r}
max_minus_min <- function(x){
  y <- (max(x) - min(x))
  return(y)
}

max_minus_min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

We'll be building on this. Development philosophy [widely attributed to the Spotify development team](http://blog.fastmonkeys.com/?utm_content=bufferc2d6e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer):

## Testing

Check your function using your own eyeballs:

- Apply to the vector 1:10. Do you get the intended result?
- Apply to a random uniform vector. Do you get meaningful results?

```{r}
max_minus_min(1:10)

max_minus_min(runif(100)) # runif(100) generates 100 random numbers between 0 and 1 -> this should give around 1
```

Let's formalize this testing with the `testthat` package. `expect_*()` functions:

```{r}
#These tests will do nothing if the test works, and they will give an error if it doesn't work
expect_equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) # this will see if .1 + .2 is equal to .3
expect_identical(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) # this will see if .1 + .2 is identical to .3 (objects are equal but not identical)
```

Add another check to the following unit test, based on the uniform random numbers:

```{r}
test_that("Simple cases work", {
    expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9) # so we are checking to see if the max_minus_min(1:10) is equal to 9, which is what we want to see
    expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)), 1) # so we would expect that the product of max_minus_min(runif(100)) would be less than 1
})

# Test that simple cases work
expect_equal(max_minus_min(1:10), 9)
expect_lt(max_minus_min(runif(100)), 1)

```

## Try and break your function

Because you will eventually forget the function specifics.

```{r}
max_minus_min(numeric(0)) #gives you an error, but not very informative
max_minus_min(gapminder) #gives you an error, but not very informative
max_minus_min(gapminder$country) #gives you an error, but not very informative
```

These don't break!

```{r}
max_minus_min(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')]) # this gives you the wrong thing, and doesn't give you an error - DANGEROUS!
max_minus_min(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)) # this changes the trues and falses into 1 and 0. No bueno
```

We want:

1. Prevent the latter cases from happening, and
2. Make a more informative error message in the former.

Check out `stopifnot` and `stop`:

```{r}
stopifnot(FALSE) 
stop("Here's my little error message.")
```

Your turn:  Use two methods:

1. Using `stopifnot`, modify the max-min function to throw an error if an input is not numeric (the `is.numeric` function is useful).

```{r}
mmm1 <- function(x) {
    stopifnot(!is.numeric(x)) # if what is in the brackets is true, then it stops 
    stop("X can only be numeric")
    max(x) - min(x)
}

mmm1(100)
```

2. Using `stop` and an `if` statement, Modify the max-min function to:
    - throw an error if an input is not numeric. In the error message, indicate what's expected as an argument, and what was recieved. 
    - return `NULL` if the input is length-0, with a warning using the `warning` function.

```{r}
#This is way better than the above function.
mmm2 <- function(x) {
    if (!is.numeric(x)) {
        stop(paste("X can only be numeric. You gave me "), typeof(x))
    }
    max(x) - min(x)
}

```

Try breaking the function now:

```{r}
mmm1((numeric(0)))
mmm1(gapminder)
mmm1(gapminder$country)
mmm1(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm1(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

mm2((numeric(0)))
mmm2(gapminder)
mmm2(gapminder$country)
mmm2(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
mmm2(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

## Naming, and generalizing to quantile difference

```{r}
x <- 1:10 #you can call this anything you want x,v,yui - it doesn't matter
mmm2(x)
```


Let's generalize the function to take the difference in two quantiles. Let's look at the difference between 2 quantiles (e.g. 0.9 quantile - 90% of the values will be below it).

```{r}
qd <- function(x, probs) { #the argument names are x, probs -> this is what you will put into the function
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x)) 
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs) # numeric value, probability -> 
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}

quantile(rnorm(100), c(0.1, 0.9)) # 10% of the time, a random draw will be below -1.613105, or above 1.101274
```

Try it out:

```{r}
x <- runif(100)
qd(x, c(0.25, 0.75)) # interquartile range - size of boxplot
IQR(x)

qd(x, c(0,1)) # these are the max and min functions
mmm2(x) 
```

Why did I call the arguments `x` and `probs`? Check out `?quantile`. 

If we input a vector stored in some variable, need that variable be named `x`?

## Defaults

Would be nice to have defaults for `probs`, right? Add them to the below code (which is copied and pasted from above).

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs = c(0,1)) { #this will make it so that the default is c(0,1). But you can still overwrite it. Here you also put in a na.rm = TRUE.
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}

qd2(rnorm(100)) # because we haven't specified the probs, it will just use (c(0,1))

qd2(rnorm(100), probs = c(0.25, 0.75)) # because we specified the probs, it will use those numbers instead.
```

## NA handling

Does this return what we were expecting?

```{r}
v <- c(1:10, NA)
qd(v)
```

Notice that `quantile()` has a `na.rm` option. Let's use it in our `qd` function. Modify the code below:

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1), na.rm = TRUE) { # this will automatically remove Na's unless otherwise stated.
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs)
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}
```

## Ellipses

There are other arguments to `quantile`, like `type`, that are not used all that much. Put them in as ellipses:

test_that() is only used when you have done a function.
stopifnot() is used within code to give you an error message.

```{r}
qd2 <- function(x, probs=c(0,1), na.rm=TRUE, ...) { # Whatever goes there will automatically go into the quantile function
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    if (length(x) == 0) {
        warning("You inputted a length-0 x. Expecting length >=1. Returning NULL.")
        return(NULL)
    } 
    qvec <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, ...) # so you are using this function within your qd2 function
    max(qvec) - min(qvec)
}

v <- rnorm(100)
qd2(v, probs = c(0,1), na.rm = TRUE, type = 1) # the type=1 argument is being used from the quantile() function. You get this with the ...
